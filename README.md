# Lupe

This is Lupe. This is a new project I have started by myself. My idea is to create an app to share images by creating trips where users will be able to add their friends on private trips to allow all of them to share their trip images.

# Technical area

Throughout my whole 5 years of experience as a Flutter developer, I have improved and developed my skills to an advanced level. Here I will show the way I work, besides the all layers, patterns, and flow I consider are necessary to create a scalable and maintainable app

## File Strucure

For the file structure, I'm implementing the approach of Domain Driven Development (DDD) to divide the app into three main layers: domain, ui, and infrastructure. Besides these layers, I also create another folder at the same level where I create and define all the things related to the app setup, utilities, and route configuration.

## State management

Throughout my whole 5 years, I have worked with several state management, and in my opinion, I consider Provider as the best state management due to its easy application, its flexibility, and its enormous capacity to be adapted and handled by different scopes and contexts.
